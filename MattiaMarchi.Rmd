*It is not important to know all things, but you will always have to know where to look.*

I am a deeply curious person and a lover of music and science. I am a Medical Doctor, specialized in Psychiatry, and I am going to start a PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (ITALY). I am also external research contributor at the University of Utrecht (the Netherlands). Here, in Italy, I do both research and clinical activities, which helps me a lot in translating the results of my research into clinical practice.

I started my research experience in peer-to-peer groups, and step-by-step I had the opportunity to expand my network to international colleagues, which many of them became also my friends.
I feel a great commitment to globalizing research collaborations, and if you're interested in hiring me, I'd love to work with you! You can contact me [here](contact.html).
